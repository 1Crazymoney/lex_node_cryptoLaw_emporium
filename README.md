## MISC LINKS, TIPS, ETC:

* Are you trying to refer to a specific deployed "smart contract" in a legal agreement and unsure of the proper way? First, know the difference between source code and bytecode & know about the possibility of compiler issues. After that, if you're like me, you probably will be inclined to refer to a smart contract as something like 'bytecode B deployed to address A on Ethereum'. But did you know the term "bytecode" is ambiguous? Which *type* of bytecode do you want to be referring to here? Well, that's up to you, but it's probably the *runtime bytecode*--see [Understanding Bytecode on Ethereum by Shane Fontaine](https://medium.com/authereum/bytecode-and-init-code-and-runtime-code-oh-my-7bcd89065904)
